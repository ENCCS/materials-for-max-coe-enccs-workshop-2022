EXERCISE 4 - Hands on the GPUs
===============================================

Test the efficiency of the GPUs.

1. Use the batch file ex4-gpu.slurm (taken from Day2-step1 exercise) to submit your job by using all the 4 GPUs available on the node (just 1 thread per task at first).
   
2. Find out how to match (roughly) the GPU performance by using CPUs only. Work with the batch file ex4-cpu.slurm.
